# Roll call results of vote events during plenary sessions of municipal assemblies in Czech Republic

Municipalities are included depending on <a href = "http://blog.openingparliament.org/post/108553329888/surveying-parliamentary-data-openness-in-6300"><strong>data availability</strong></a>. In case of several larger municipalities that publish roll call results in the HTML format, there are live scrapers of the official municipal websites that run weekly. In other cases, the data is recorded manually based on minutes from the plenary sessions. This data is updated irregularly. Data from the Municipal Assembly of Prague are scraped by <a href = "https://github.com/michalskop/datapackages"><strong>Michal Škop</strong></a> and updated irregularly.
